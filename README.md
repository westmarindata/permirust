# permirust

permirust is an extensible database permission manager, written in Rust. It
is a spiritual successor to the excellent [permifrost](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/permifrost)
and [pgbedrock](https://github.com/squarespace/pgbedrock) projects.

It is currently in very active development, so don't use it!
